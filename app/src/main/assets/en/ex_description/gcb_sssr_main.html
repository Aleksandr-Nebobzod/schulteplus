            <h2>More about spheres</h2>
            <p>
                For the youngest: <a href="https://telegra.ph/The-version-112-Spheres-Space-09-02">Spheres of the Stone Age</a>
            </p>

            <h3>Possible spheres of life being tracked</h3>
            <ul>

                <li><b>Work / Study:</b> specifically related to social responsibility and self-sufficiency, extremely important for harmonious self-awareness. There must be a sense of reward and dignity from work. Moreover, the activity should bring more pleasure than stress (though managed stress should be present at times). Fun fact: people with passive income who neglect this sphere mostly degrade.
                <li><b>Physical activity:</b> we talk a lot about the mind, but often forget that the body is the energy supplier for the brain. Keeping the body in shape, regularly subjecting it to reasonable stress, and caring for its flexibility and health is necessary for the harmonious functioning of the mind. Plato, a well-known sage (by the way, it's not a name but a nickname meaning "broad" or "stocky"), was a wrestling champion in his youth.
                <li><b>Entertainment and rest:</b> the famous saying "there’s time for work and time for fun" is often misinterpreted to mean that work time is long, and fun time is short. In reality, both words mean synonyms, and the folk wisdom implies "a time to gather and a time to scatter stones" without limiting the amount. Regular, sufficient, varied rest is essential for work. If we want to be productive, we must ensure rest for both body and mind, as well as variety in impressions and tasks.
                <li><b>Family, Friends:</b> these categories are close as they provide extremely important and similar signals: human warmth, unity, understanding. If these feelings are lacking, it will lead to a deficiency in corresponding hormones, negatively affecting the mind.
                    <br><b>Now about the differences</b>. Family is crucial because it forms deep, close relationships. Friends belong more to the outer circle, with greater distance and less intensity. Moreover, for young and adult people, romantic relationships fall into opposite spheres.
                <li><b>Household and daily life:</b> seemingly secondary matters in life. But as the saying goes, "clothes make the man," and these are not empty words. On a subconscious level, tasks related to hygiene, self-care, and tidy appearance ensure safety. This is important. Ask a microbiologist or a safety specialist. While the second part of the saying is "greet with intelligence," you still have to get there, and we see ourselves in the mirror every day—it's wise to broadcast positive signals.
                <li><b>Sleep:</b> Regular, healthy sleep in sufficient quantities is the physiological foundation of a harmonious and productive life. Unfortunately, bodily processes during sleep take time and require adequate nutrition. Without it, hormone regulation (primarily in the brain) cannot function properly; memory, attention, and focus depend on the quality of sleep.
                <li><b>Sphere of Free Self-Realization</b> (USSR): it should be present in everyone's life, with allocated time and energy. This is not work (even if creative), nor games (there’s too much following in them), nor household chores (even if you're cooking a new dish), nor a hobby (it’s too process-driven for this). However, if it's mastering a new hobby—it can indeed be part of the USSR.
            </ul>

            <h3>Principles of choice</h3>
            <p>
                It's necessary to consider which life spheres seem important to us and which ones are recommended by loved ones whose advice we heed. This is a basic list, and it can be expanded or reduced. For example, a programmer probably doesn't need to allocate a separate mental sphere beyond work, just as a stonemason doesn't need to focus too much on physical activity beyond his labor, except for flexibility and stretching.
                <br>The only sphere that cannot be excluded is the USSR.
            </p>
            <p>
                The goal is to ensure that each parameter, <u>over a period (week or month)</u>, occupies a stable target area on the graph.
                (Of course, work takes more time and energy than friends, but relative values are considered: 40 hours of work per week is 100%, and 10 hours with friends is also 100%, and so on. Each significant sphere should be regularly represented in life; otherwise, it's a cause for disharmony).

        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <p>
            Find a place for a secluded, contemplative activity for 3-5 minutes. Close your eyes.
            Allow thoughts to drift through the events of the previous day without focusing on any one thing.
            <br>For each impression, silently<a href="en/ex_description/gcb_sssr_main.html#foot1">[1]</a> note its trace:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>emotional tone;</li>
            <li>resource expenditure in this event (time, physical effort, emotional tension)</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            At some point, you'll notice that the main events have formed an "inventory list" and
            your mind selects impressions that have already been covered. This means you can form
            a coherent mental object from the accumulated traces of impressions.
            <br>(Without applying cognitive work, you can stop here and assess your impressions
            by categories, gauging the overall intensity of the day and the relationships of the spheres).
        </p>

        <p>
            While unfolding the resulting eidos (or meaning)<a href="en/ex_description/gcb_sssr_main.html#foot2">[2]</a>, use sliders to note the presence of selected spheres in the reviewed day, and then fill out the self-observation journal (overall emotional and energy levels).
        </p>
        <p>
            A diary plays a special role in this exercise, i.e., textual comments on the day's events.
            This technique, recommended by psychologists and called free-writing, helps release emotional tension and organize thoughts. It’s often advised to write by hand, but in today’s world... personally, I used typing on a tablet and found it to be a convenient tool.
        </p>
        <h2>Summary</h2>

        <p>
            Many of us keep diaries or kept them in childhood. The therapeutic effect of this tool is greatly underestimated. With modern technologies, its accessibility, convenience, categorization, and text search make it indispensable. Of course, we also train spatial perception, abstraction, long-term memory, and system thinking.
