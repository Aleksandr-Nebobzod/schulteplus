    <p>
        Questions about measuring mental state have long been a mystery for philosophers
        and continue to be of interest to modern scientists. At the beginning of the 20th century,
        German psychiatrist Walter Schulte (<a href="https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walter_Schulte">Wikipedia (Deutsch). W. Schulte</a>) developed the Schulte Tables — a psychodiagnostic method for studying and developing attention properties. (<a href="https://handwiki.org/wiki/Schulte_table">Handwiki (English). Schulte tables</a>)
        <br>The development effect in his work is particularly significant, as it is quantitatively measurable, and thus objective.
        Many researchers confirm the positive impact of such training and use it for general development (including children, under adult supervision of course) and for specific tasks such as speed reading skills.
    </p>
    <p>
        The space of "Schulte" represents an original stimulus material in the form of a table, with elements<a href="en/ex_description/space200_schulte.html#foot1">[1]</a> of sequences placed randomly in the cells but need to be opened in an orderly manner:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>5x5 <b>One sequence</b><a href="en/ex_description/space200_schulte.html#foot2">[2]</a>, increasing, for example: <br>1, 2, 3, 4, ... 25; or: A, B, C, D.... or I, II, III, IV, V, VI,,,,</li>
        <li>7x7 <b>Two sequences</b>, one by one: increasing blue and decreasing red<a href="en/ex_description/space200_schulte.html#foot3">[3]</a>. Example: <br>1b, 24r; 2b, 23r; 3b, 22r; 4b, 22r; ... 24b; 1r, 25b;</li>
        <li>10x10 <b>Four sequences</b>, step by step changing next color: increasing blue, decreasing red, converging green: diverging yellow:
            <br>1b, 25r, 1g, 13y; <br>2b, 24r, 25g, 14y; <br>3b, 23r, 2g, 12y; <br>4b, 22r, 24g, 15y,  <br>... 25b, 1r, 13g, 1y;</li>
    </ul>

    <a name="instructions"></a>
    <h5>Instruction</h5>
    <p>
        The feature of working with Schulte tables is the calm, rhythmic use of attention without pronounced events.
        Strive to perceive the entire table, along with its changes, as a single whole process. The following techniques help us with this:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Peripheral vision</b>. That is, during the search for the next element, try to keep the gaze in the center of the table.</li>
        <li><b>Silent understanding</b>. Strive to relax the speech apparatus and the corresponding function of consciousness so as not to interfere with attention doing its full work.</li>
        <li><b>Process goal-setting</b>. It is important to perform regular training. Achievement milestones will come by themselves; sooner or later it will become noticeable. Whereas the competitive aspect generally takes a resource away from the practitioner.
            <br>(just do not do things like: "well, I am moving faster now than last time", "oh, another mistake!", "today I will beat Vasya, Masha,.." and so on)
            <br>Only the process. In a sense, even "I" is absent here. Let "I" return after the training and write a useful note.</li>
    </ul>

    <h5>Summary</h5>
    <p>
        Yes, the volume of attention grows, the breadth of perception on the periphery definitely grows. Even such psychological qualities as perseverance, discipline, stress tolerance. And besides:
        <br><i>The conditioned forms of this exercise space and the high dynamics of attention work
        allow discovering especially subtle aspects of consciousness functions...</i>
        <br>The exercise results list is available in the <a href="en/ex_description/space300_stata.html">"Stats"</a> window.
    </p>
    <h5>Self-Monitoring Journal</h5>
    <p>
        Summarizing each exercise, you can maintain and analyze the history of self-observations, various aspects of your overall condition, and during practices. This can help track your progress, development pace, and adjust efforts according to your state.
    </p>
    <p>
        <span style="color:red;">Attention! Personal note:</span>
        <br>10-30 minutes a day is a general recommendation for the duration of sessions with Schulte tables. Choose your training pace mindfully, listening to your individuality. Schulte tables are a high-intensity trainer.
        <br>In case of a sustained (3-5 days) decline in results, especially if emotional and energy levels are also reduced, we strongly recommend:
    <ul>
        <li>stopping Schulte table training;
            <br><i>(you can replace them with less intense exercises)</i></li>
        <li>allocating time for walks in the fresh air;</li>
        <li>normalizing sleep patterns;</li>
        <li>normalizing dietary patterns;</li>
    </ul>
    After a week of rest and recovery of attention resources, you can carefully try Schulte table training again. If the psyche again responds with noticeable resistance, we recommend choosing another trainer (words, colored balls, <a href="en/ex_description/space100_base.html">basic exercises</a>).
    <br>Take care of yourself! You are very much needed by yourself!
