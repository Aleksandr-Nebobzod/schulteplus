            This training hall is designed to sharpen your ability to quickly assess a situation,
            accurately determine its characteristics, and successfully forecast your future states,
            events and plans. The space is organized simply and aimed at completing practical tasks
            as quickly as possible.
            <br>These techniques combine the approaches of stalking and recapitulation in the terms
            of C. Castaneda. The recommended sequence for mastering them is to collect at least
            300 psy-coins in the Base Hall before moving on to the Intercept exercise cycle.
            After a month or two of such stalking, the USSR (Unquestionable Sphere of Self-Realization)
            will become simpler, fuller, and more productive.
            <br>On the other hand, the USSR exercise is available to beginners and even people
            who are completely unfamiliar with the ideas of psychotechnics (as in the Pomodoro approach).
            Therefore, if desired, you can start with it, and when you have more resources for detailed work,
            you can master Intercept.

        <p>
            The list of exercise results is available in the <a href="en/ex_description/space300_stata.html">"Stats"</a> window.
            <br>Of course, the exercises in this hall aim to cultivate mindfulness as a constantly active function of consciousness. However, as shown by the numerous experiences of our trainees, significant and rapid effects of the "Sphere" exercise cycle include:
        <ul>
            <li>stress reduction,</li>
            <li>relief from feelings of uncertainty,</li>
            <li>increased confidence in your success.</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
