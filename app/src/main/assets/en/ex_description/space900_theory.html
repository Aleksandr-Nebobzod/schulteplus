    <h2>Attention</h2>

    <ul>
        <li><b>direction</b> of consciousness towards a specific object;</li>
        <li><b>process</b> of selecting the most important information from the external and internal environment.</li>
        <li><b>state of wakefulness</b> (vigilance) — a necessary foundation for the processes of attention to occur.</li>
    </ul>

    <a name="instructions"></a>
    <h2>Types of Attention</h2>

    <ol>
        <li><strong>Involuntary attention</strong> (“passive”, imposed by the external situation) — directed independently of the person's conscious intention, when the properties of acting stimuli (their intensity, novelty, connection with needs, etc.) attract the focus of attention. For example, the sight of a ripe apple on a branch outside the window may unexpectedly draw our attention to it, especially if we are hungry at that moment.</li>
        <li><strong>Voluntary attention</strong> (“active”, controlled by consciousness) — consciously directed and regulated attention, where the subject chooses the object to which attention will be focused. For instance, we might decide to go to the garden for apples to treat a child. Voluntary attention is mentioned when the object of focus would not attract attention by itself if not for the individual's desire. Voluntary attention allows a person's cognition and activity to "rise to the level of conscious organization, rather than being spontaneous, dictated by external forces" (S.L. Rubinstein).</li>
        <li><strong>Post-voluntary attention</strong> also has a purposeful character but does not require constant volitional effort for its realization. For example, sometimes while reading, it is difficult to keep attention on the content: it is hard, boring, and not particularly important to us. But at some moment, unnoticed by ourselves, we stop making an effort, read without tension, and the reading material captivates us. Attention has shifted from voluntary to post-voluntary. From this, it follows that the ordinary reading process is accompanied by constant fluctuations in attention, which significantly determine the pace and quality of reading. In reading text, involuntary attention mainly depends on the author and their skill, while voluntary attention depends on the reader themselves. (from the book by O.A. Andreev and L.N. Khromov "Learn to Read Quickly").</li>
    </ol>
    <details>
        <summary>More details from neurophysiology...</summary>
        <p>
            Currently, a quite complex neurophysiological organization of attention processes is assumed, with three main networks related to the components described above — maintaining wakefulness, voluntary and involuntary attention. In simplified terms, the brain organization of these processes can be defined as follows: 1) maintaining wakefulness is primarily supported by the reticular formation of the brainstem; 2) for the implementation of involuntary attention and orienting reflex, the thalamus, limbic system structures, and sensory cortex (including parietal areas) are crucial; 3) voluntary attention (and executive control) is ensured by the activity of the frontal lobes of the cerebral cortex and the anterior cingulate cortex (see, for example,
            <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3413263/pdf/nihms394960.pdf">the works of M. Posner</a>).
            Attentiveness is a characteristic of cognitive abilities and human properties. Attentiveness to stimuli with certain characteristics <u>can be developed through training</u><a href="en/ex_description/space900_theory.html#foot1">[1]</a> or as skills in the relevant subject area are acquired (for example, as a physician gains clinical experience, their attention becomes increasingly focused and adapted to identify the signs of diseases they frequently encounter).

    <h2>Properties of Attention</h2>
    <p>
        Terminology from the book "<a href="https://psy.wikireading.ru/hPOIo3Tw69">Psychology of Attention (Russian)</a>" by Gippenreiter Y.B.
        <br>(see also "<a href="https://www.studysmarter.co.uk/explanations/psychology/basic-psychology/attention/#anchor-3">Smart Study Site</a>").
    <ol>
        <li><b>Volume of attention</b>
            <br>In psychology, this refers to the amount of impressions that can be perceived with full clarity and distinctness in one act of attention.</li>
        <li><b>Focus (Concentration, Selectivity) of attention</b>
            <br>The ability to maintain focus on one object against a background for a certain period (see the article on the <a href="https://link.springer.com/referenceworkentry/10.1007/978-0-387-79948-3_1303#:~:text=Focused%20attention%2C%20the%20ability%20to,course%20of%20an%20ongoing%20activity.">Springer Link</a> resource).</li>
        <li><b>Distribution of attention</b>
            <br>To pay attention to two or more different directions at the same time: for example, simultaneously reciting a poem aloud and performing calculations in writing.</li>
        <li><b>Sustainability of attention</b>
            <br>The duration of time during which a person can maintain their attention on an object (and the reverse characteristic: Distractibility).</li>
        <li><b>De-concentration of attention</b>
            <br>This is a special skill and mode of attention work, where it is evenly distributed across all stimuli including figures and background, while we are aware of everything and adequately react to changes in stimuli.</li>
        <li><b>Intensity of attention</b>
            <br>"We do not yet have any commonly accepted measure of the intensity of attention."
            <br><em>(Do not confuse the intensity of attention with the feeling of unpleasant tension that often arises in us, especially under conditions of purely voluntary attention. This unpleasant feeling expresses only our effort to achieve a sufficient degree of attention intensity, our struggle for this intensity.)</em>
            <br>Additionally, the following characteristics of attention are not considered on our resource: Adaptation speed, Transition speed, Fatigue (fluctuations).
